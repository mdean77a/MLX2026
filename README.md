# MLX2026
Explorations of using Apple MLX library to duplicate patterns used in AI Makerspace Bootcamps.

My goal is to use notebooks as executable "README.md" files that will also tell the user how to use the code that is outside of the notebooks.

Assumption for user is that they are using Apple silicon since MLX will not work elsewhere.
