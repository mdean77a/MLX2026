      "**Instructions:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rinse the rice:** Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and helps prevent sticky, clumpy grains.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Soak (optional but recommended):** In a bowl, cover the rinsed rice with cold water and let it soak for 15 to 30 minutes. This helps the grains absorb water evenly and results in fluffier texture.  \n",

      "5. **Bring to a boil:** Increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.  \n",

      "6. **Reduce heat and cover:** Once boiling, immediately reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for 15–20 minutes (for white rice).  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Rest:** After 15–20 minutes, remove from heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5–10 minutes. This \"resting\" period allows the steam to finish cooking the grains and gives them a soft, fluffy texture.  \n",
      "\n",

      "**How to Cook Fluffy White Rice (Original Version)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**  \n",
      "- 2 cups uncooked white rice (e.g., long-grain, jasmine, or basmati)  \n",
      "- 3 cups water (or 2.5 cups for sticky rice)  \n",
      "- 1–2 tablespoons oil or butter (optional, for flavor and texture)  \n",
      "- A pinch of salt (optional, for taste)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rinse the rice:** Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and helps prevent sticky, clumpy grains.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Soak (optional but recommended):** In a bowl, cover the rinsed rice with cold water and let it soak for 15 to 30 minutes. This helps the grains absorb water evenly and results in fluffier texture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat the pot:** In a medium to large pot, heat 1–2 tablespoons of oil or butter over medium heat.  \n",

      "4. **Add rice and water:** Add the soaked rice to the pot. Pour in the 3 cups of water (or 2.5 cups for sticky rice). Stir gently to combine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bring to a boil:** Increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Reduce heat and cover:** Once boiling, immediately reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for 15–20 minutes (for white rice).  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Rest:** After 15–20 minutes, remove from heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5–10 minutes. This \"resting\" period allows the steam to finish cooking the grains and gives them a soft, fluffy texture.  \n",
      "\n",
